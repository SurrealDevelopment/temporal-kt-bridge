/**
 * Process-lifecycle safety net for [EphemeralServer] instances.
 *
 * Ephemeral servers are real child processes spawned by Core. Core kills the child when the
 * server is dropped (`kill_on_drop`), and the bridge shuts it down when a start is abandoned or a
 * runtime is freed -- but nothing ties the child to this JVM once the JVM is gone. A JVM that dies
 * without closing a server (force-stopped test run, `kill -9`, hard crash) leaves it running.
 *
 * What that costs has changed. With the C bridge the child inherited the JVM's stdout/stderr, so
 * an orphan held a Gradle test worker's pipes open and the build hung forever; that was the
 * reason this file exists. The kt-bridge redirects the child's stdio to a file or /dev/null, so an
 * orphan is now only a stray process holding a port. This file is therefore hygiene, not a hang
 * preventer, and it is kept because stray servers accumulate on developer machines.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, both exact (no process-table guessing):
 * 1. Every started server is registered here and unregistered on close. A JVM shutdown hook
 *    closes whatever is still registered, so normal and `System.exit` exits never leave a child.
 * 2. Each registered server's process is recorded in a per-JVM file under [registryDir] as
 *    `<pid> <processStartMillis>`, keyed by this JVM's own pid and start time. [reapOrphans]
 *    reads the records of JVMs that no longer exist and kills exactly those processes, after
 *    checking the pid still refers to the recorded process (start time match, so a reused pid
 *    is never killed). The test fixture calls it once per JVM.
 *
 * There used to be a third: `start` was made non-cancellable and closed the server it produced
 * if its caller had been cancelled meanwhile. The bridge now does that itself on both sides of
 * the boundary (a completion that lost its race releases the handle it carried), so that code
 * is gone rather than kept as a second, unreachable copy.
